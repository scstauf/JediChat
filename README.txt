jedIRC is a chat application I wrote for my Advanced Java class at OCCC.

After starting a JediServer, start a JediClient for each computer on your network.

Connect to the server with this command:

/connect username@server_addr:port

After a couple of clients have connected, you can send messages to the server and they will be broadcasted to each client.
